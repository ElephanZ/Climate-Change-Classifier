## Introduction

This project consists, given a series of tweets about Climate Change, in figuring out whether the user (the author) is skeptic or supports the belief of man-made climate change. Once implemented, trained, and tested, this algorithm will be useful in some real contests.

To solve this problem, I have made an algorithm (a classifier) which has been trained on a **43943 tweets** dataset collected between 2015-04-27 and 2018-02-21 by ***Canada Foundation for Innovation JELF Grant to Chris Bauch, University of Waterloo***. <br/>
Each row of the dataset contains: the text of the tweet labelled as '*message*', the tweet id labelled as '*tweetid*', and the sentiment of the tweet labelled as '*sentiment*'.

Each sentiment is labelled as one of the following classes:
- ``-1`` (**Anti**) &#8594; the tweet author doesn't believe in man-made climate change;
- ``0`` (**Neutral**) &#8594; the tweet author neither supports nor refutes the belief of man-made climate change;
- ``1`` (**Pro**) &#8594; the tweet author supports the belief of man-made climate change;
- ``2`` (**News**) &#8594; the tweet links to factual news about climate change;

## Real World Application

I've made tests on two US profiles owned by well known activists (**Greta Thunberg** and **Leonardo Di Caprio**). <br/>
In time, with an appropriate dataset, may be maked analytics on how many VIPs are interested (and how) on climate change for each main job category (such as politics, cinema, football, etc).

## Conclusions

I have tested and compared five classification algorithms. The best is SVM, followed in order by Logistic Regression, SGD, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Multinomial Naive-Bayes. To better classify text should be used a Neural Network.

I got Pros ðŸ†— and Cons â›” in this project due to the basic models used, and the not well-proportioned dataset:
* ðŸ†— when tweets are really about climate change, the model works well enough.
* ðŸ†— it is "quick" and was really useful for introduce me into Machine Learning world.
* ðŸ†— it is easy to read and has been easy to write.
* â›” when tweets are not about climate change, the model doesn't works (it base probably its prediction on tweet sentiment without really understand the topic).
* â›” when tweets contains humorism, the model doesn't work very well.

To conclude: I have learned a lot by implementing this project. I have used in pratic a lot of theoric notions studied during my Social Media Management course at university
